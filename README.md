# stock-prediction
A machine learning project for predicting stock prices using deep learning and classical ML techniques. The model combines LSTM neural networks (for sequence modeling) with scikit-learn tools for preprocessing and evaluation.

Features:
1.Predicts future stock prices based on historical data

2.Uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time series forecasting

3.Data normalization with MinMaxScaler (sklearn)

4.Performance evaluation using RMSE

5.Visualizes actual vs predicted stock trends

6.Fetches stock data via Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage (as per your code)

7.Streamlit frontend for live testing (optional)


 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy

LSTM (TensorFlow / Keras)

scikit-learn (MinMaxScaler, RMSE)

Matplotlib / Plotly for visualization

Streamlit (if included in your project)
